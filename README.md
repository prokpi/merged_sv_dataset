# merged_sv_dataset
This repository contains scripts to process genomic VCF files, calculate GC content, Mosdepth coverage and integrate predictions from multiple structural variant callers (e.g., Manta, Delly, Smoove). The final output is a consolidated dataset for machine learning, enabling assessment of prediction of structural variations.
