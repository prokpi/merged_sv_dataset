# merged_sv_dataset
This repository contains scripts to process genomic VCF files, calculate GC content, Mosdepth coverage and integrate predictions from multiple structural variant callers (Manta, Delly, Smoove). The final output is a consolidated dataset for machine learning, enabling assessment of prediction of structural variations.
